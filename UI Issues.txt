UI/UX Flaws:

1) Although creating/updating the board is successful, only the board's title is visible on the top left corner, not the description. We could create an "About" Section for the board but in the main dashboard of the user.
8) When "Edit Task" panel is opened, the "Assignee" field should be filled with the current user info that the task is assigned to (in the same way that user info is displayed when viewing members in dropdown list). Upon clicking the dropdown list, the "tick" must appear after the current assignee. When editing a task, if the current Assignee is none for that task, then its fine for it to be empty.   
9) The keyboard overlaps input when typing.. One of the tutorials I saw, used "KeyBoardAwareScrollView" component from "react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view". I have already installed "react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view". You just need to import { KeyBoardAwareScrollView } from react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view and use it in its appropriate place.
10) Admin-member controls: Currently, when a member signs into a board, he/she has the full autonomy to updateTask(), createTask(), deleteTask(). When the admin signs into a board, he/she has the full autonomy to addBoardMember(), removeBoardMember(), updateTask(), createTask(), deleteTask(), updateBoard(). I want that a member signing into a board can only update a few fields of a task. These include updating the description, labels, statuses(a member can only change the status to "In-Review", "In-Progress", "To-Do" statuses, not the "Done" Status). When the admin signs into a board, he/she has the full autonomy to addBoardMember(), removeBoardMember(), updateTask(), createTask(), deleteTask(), updateBoard(). You could implement a boolean to display the options according to the role of the board member. For example, isAdmin is true, then display all the options else only display a few options.
12) When updating/creating a certain task within a board, include a check within the Due Date field that only dates more than or equal to the CURRENT_DATE are allowed. Setting a date in the past should throw an Alert with the message, "Don't go into the past. Think about the Future!" Order all the tasks by the amount of time left for thier respective deadlines. This can be done by keeping the current time in referrence.
